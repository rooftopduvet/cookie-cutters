Installing & Running Tests
**************************

The dependancy management system for this codebase is
`Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_, which means that you
should be able to install and run tests with the usual Poetry
commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry install
    poetry run pytest --cov-report=xml --cov={{cookiecutter.module_name}} tests/

However, if you do not wish to modify your local environment, the codebase
is also set up to run with Docker:

.. code-block:: bash

    make install        // Builds the dev container
    make dev-shell      // Starts the dev container
    make lint           // Runs the linter within the dev container
    make test           // Runs pytest within the dev container
    make uninstall      // Uninstalls the dev container (using 'docker rmi')
